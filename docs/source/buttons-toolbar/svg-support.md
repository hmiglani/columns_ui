# SVG support

To add SVG support to the buttons toolbar, install
[SVG services](https://yuo.be/svg-services).

Youâ€™ll then be able to use static SVG images as custom images for buttons.

If your buttons are a non-standard size, installing SVG services will also
improve the quality of built-in button images.
